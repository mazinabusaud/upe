Member file guide
===================

Every member file needs to follow this format. I don't do error checking for
parsing member files so if the format isn't right it'll break the site.


Line 1: Member name<br>
Line 2: Member title<br>
Line 3: Member join date<br>
Line 4: Member github line<br>
Line 5: Member email<br>
Line 6: Member skills/Topics willing to help with<br>

If you don't want information displayed for a member leave a blank line.
The president's file should be labled 1.txt, so forth for decending members.
For examples check out members files in the inc/member directory.

The follow file names map to officers:<br>
1: President<br>
2: Vice President<br>
3: Secretary<br>
4: Treasurer<br>
