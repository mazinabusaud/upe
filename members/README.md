THIS IS A TEMPLATE FOR A MEMBER FILE
Every member file needs to follow this format. I don't do error checking for
parsing member files so if the format isn't right it'll break the site.

Line 1: Member name
Line 2: Member title
Line 3: Member join date
Line 4: Member github line
Line 5: Member email
Line 6: Member skills/Topics willing to help with

If you don't want information displayed for a member leave a blank line.
The president's file should be labled 1.txt, so forth for decending members.
For examples check out members files in the inc/member directory.

The follow file names map to officers:
1: President
2: Vice President
3: Secretary
4: Treasurer
