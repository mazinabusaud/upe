Member file guide
===================

Every member file needs to follow this format. I don't do error checking for
parsing member files so if the format isn't right it'll break the site.


Line 1: Name<br>
Line 2: Club position<br>
Line 3: Join date<br>
Line 4: Github URL/Website<br>
Line 5: Email<br>
Line 6: Skills/Topics willing to help with<br>

If you don't want information displayed for a member leave a blank line.
Each member file should be put in the member directory.
