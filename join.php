          <p> Upsilon Pi Epsilon (UPE) is an honorary society whose membership consists of outstanding 
          undergraduates and graduates in the Computing Sciences. 
          Since its establishment in 1967, UPE has grown to become an international organization with chapters 
          at leading colleges and universities. Membership  in UPE is limited to those individuals demonstrating 
          distinguished academic and professional achievement.<br><br>
      
          Upsilon Pi Epsilon is the first, and only, existing international honor society in the Computing Sciences.
          It has received the endorsement of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM).<br><br>
